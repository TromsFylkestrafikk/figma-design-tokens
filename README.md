# Export Design Tokens (W3C) from Figma

This plugin exports Figma variables into separate JSON files per collection and modes grouped in a .zip file for easy download. 

## Background
This plugin has been created for managing the design system of the public mobility collaboration (Offentlig Mobilitetssamarbeid [OMS]) in Norway. This project creates whitelabel software for the public transport sector, which can then be shared across the entire country. This means that multiple organisations are creating multiple themes using this design system. To manage the complexity, Figma variables are considered the source of truth for design decisions.
